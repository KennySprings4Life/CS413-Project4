		<h1>Instructions</h1>
		<p>How to play my game:  Move the character up and down with 'W' and 'S', respectively. Move the character right with 'D' and left with 'A'</p>
		<p>I kept switching what it was that I wanted to do for this project because I felt that each idea</p>
		<p>didnt't fully meet the requirements of the assignment.</p>
		<p>In the end I just stuck with my original idea because it was what I wanted to do the most, although as you can see I ran out of time.</p>
		<p>Anywho, I added in some plants for y'all to look at so that I could at least show them off, although ideally you would have to plant and water</p>
		<p>all of the crops yourself.</p>
		<p>P.S. Sorry I don't have any more music for y'all for this project. I really enjoyed making the music for project 3</p>
